# exPat Journal Front-End

# What problem does your app solve?
- Explicitly photos for traveling. 
- More professional instagram.


# What is the mission statement?
- Travel Far, Travel Often.

# MVP Requirements

1. User can visit site and see photos laid out in a grid
2. Travelers can create, read, update, and delete stories and photos. (No ability to upload one's own photos for MVP)

# Stretch Goal

1. Build an image uploader into the site to allow users the ability to upload their own assets. (This will require some work with a package called Drop Zone and a service called cloudinary).
